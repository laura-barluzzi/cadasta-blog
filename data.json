      "summary": "I started to self-learn back in July 2016. During the first five months (July-Nov), I used to follow the great MIT course [“Introduction to Computer Science and Programming”](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/). Alongside, I used to read the book [“Learn Python the Hard Way”](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by _Zed A. Shaw_. Shaw’s book is practical and has about 50 exercises: in the last one you create a simple web-game.\nAfter concluding both the book and the course, I decided to explore different ‘must-do’ languages. In November 2016 I joined the Free Code Camp community to learn basics about Javascript, HTML, CSS and web-development. At the end of January 2017 I obtained their [Front End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/laura-barluzzi/front-end-certification). I highly recommend their front-end exercises and tutorials, I learnt a lot from them!\n In late February 2017, while starting a voting application as part of the back-end exercises, I received a notification from the *Freecodecamp Vancouver Facebook group*: someone posted about a job opening for the Outreachy summer internship program. Was I eligible? Yes. Was it doable for my level? Maybe. After a bit of thinking, I decided to give it a try. For the entire month of March I learned how to use Git and I contributed on the [cadasta-platform](https://github.com/Cadasta/cadasta-platform) by fixing some issues. Understanding code written by other people and spread-out in hundreds of documents was not an easy task. I couldn’t have make it without the help of other developers who answered my questions...\n...my hard-work and self-directive research paid off though – the Cadasta team chose me as their Outreachy 2017 summer intern! Keep up the hard work!",

      "summary": "I grew up in a small Alpine Italian city called Belluno. Since I was a teenager, I started volunteering at a local fairtrade shop and I became ‘famous’ among my peers for my dedication to social causes. Although I was studying accounting and programming (I know, funny), my interests in human rights and global justice brought me to pursue international development studies. For about 10 years, *my dream was to work for NGOs*, co-operatives and enterprises that promote social justice.\nIn November 2015 I obtained my Master and the job hunting phase in international development began. Over a period of 7-8 months I applied to a couple of hundreds of openings all over the world. I’d say I wrote *thousands* of lines in motivation letters and many pre-structured application forms. However, I received *only one answer: _a rejection_*. What a bummer! In Vancouver at least I obtained an opportunity at the _British Columbia Council for International Development (BCCIC)_. Although the internship went great, their budget and hands were tied so they had to let me go.\nIt was in July 2016 that I realized two things: (1) I was *not really specialized* in anything; and (2) A *safe paid career was not going to happen* in international development. With a sour taste in my mouth, I convinced myself to purse a *plan B*. But was this a defeat? I actually then realized that defeat would have been to keep going based on a [sunk cost fallacy](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/).\nAs a consequnce, for 9-months I have been self-learning programming, and today I’m about to start an internship as a software developer at Cadasta. Cadasta enables people in developing countries to better protect and manage their land rights -- ironically, my plan B is enabling my plan A... life is funny, isn't it?",
